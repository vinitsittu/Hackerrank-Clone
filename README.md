# Hackerrank-Clone
My HackerRank clone is a web application that allows users to practice coding questions and challenges. It features a variety of questions in different programming languages, as well as a leaderboard to track users' progress.

Users can create an account and log in to start practicing questions. Each question has a description, code editor, and submit button. When the user clicks the submit button, their code is run and the output is displayed below the code editor.

The leaderboard shows the top users in terms of solved questions and points. Users can also filter the leaderboard by language and difficulty.

My HackerRank clone is still under development, but I am working on adding new features, such as a code linter, test runner, and editorials for each question.

Here is a summary of the features of my HackerRank clone:

Practice coding questions in different programming languages
Leaderboard to track users' progress
Code editor and submit button for each question
Output of the code is displayed below the code editor
Filterable leaderboard by language and difficulty
